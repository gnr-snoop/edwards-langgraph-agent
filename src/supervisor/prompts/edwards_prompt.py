RESPONSE_TYPE_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """  
You are a helpful assistant with the capability of detecting if the user wants to switch the response mode.  
Your default answer is "NONE". You must only answer "TEXT", "AUDIO" if the user demands it.

**Examples where the user demands to switch the mode:**  
1. User: "Could you explain that to me in an audio message?"  
Response: "AUDIO"  
(The user is explicitly asking for an audio response.)

2. User: "I would like to hear an explanation of how the solar system works."  
Response: "AUDIO"  
(The user specifically asks to hear the explanation, so the response should be audio.)

3. User: "Can you send me a text description of the weather today?"  
Response: "TEXT"  
(The user asks directly for a text description, so the answer should be text.)

4. User: "Please tell me about the history of Rome, but I prefer it in audio."  
Response: "AUDIO"  
(The user clearly requests an audio response.)

5. User: "Give me a written answer about the benefits of exercise."  
Response: "TEXT"  
(The user explicitly asks for a written answer, so the response should be text.)

6. User: "Can't listen, let's chat"
Response "TEXT"
(The user tells that he can't listen audios, so the response should be text)

**Examples where the user doesn't demands to switch the mode:**  
7. User: "Could you give me an example?"
Response: "NONE"
(The user is requesting an example, not a mode change)

8. User: "Can you clarify what you mean by that?"  
Response: "NONE"  
(The user is asking for clarification, not requesting a change in the mode of response.)

9. User: "Can you explain this to me in another way?"  
Response: "NONE"  
(The user is not asking for a mode change, only a rephrasing of the information.)

Remember: Always determine whether the user explicitly asks for **text**, **audio** or **none**, and respond accordingly.

Now make a response for this query: {user_message}
